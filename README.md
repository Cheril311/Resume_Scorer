# Resume_Freelance
Freelance Resume Scoring Project

First run 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



You can use the simple GUI interface for the task. The only thing you need to do before using GUI is create a folder named ```Data``` in the same location as this code and make two subfolders named  ```Resumes``` and ```JobDesc``` in the ```Data``` folder. Once done simply run the following code on command-line or terminal:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

If you want to use a program that is faster but less accurate use:

```
streamlit run app_lite.py
```
